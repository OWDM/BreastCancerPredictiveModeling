# BreastCancerPredictiveModeling

## Introduction
BreastCancerPredictiveModeling is a machine learning project focused on the analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. The goal is to accurately classify tumors into malignant or benign categories based on computed features from fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsy images. This project aims to leverage advanced data processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the diagnostic process for breast cancer.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 569 samples, with each sample described by 30 features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features capture characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image, including aspects like texture, shape, and size. For further details and to download the dataset, visit the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/breast-cancer-wisconsin-diagnostic-dataset/data).

## Technologies and Libraries Used
This project is implemented using Python, with the following libraries:
- `NumPy` for numerical computations.
- `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
- `Scikit-learn` for machine learning model implementation and evaluation.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
3. Install the required libraries using:
4. Download the dataset from the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/breast-cancer-wisconsin-diagnostic-dataset/data) and place it in the `data/` directory within the project folder.

## Usage
To run the analysis, navigate to the project directory and execute the main script:
Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your script. This script will preprocess the data, train the models, and output the classification reports.
